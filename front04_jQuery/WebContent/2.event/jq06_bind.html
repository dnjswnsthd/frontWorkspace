      As of jQuery 3.0, .bind() has been deprecated. It was superseded by the
      .on() method for attaching event handlers to a document since jQuery 1.7,
      so its use was already discouraged. For earlier versions, the .bind()
      method is used for attaching an event handler directly to elements.
      Handlers are attached to the currently selected elements in the jQuery
      object, so those elements must exist at the point the call to .bind()
      occurs. For more flexible event binding, see the discussion of event
      delegation in .on().
